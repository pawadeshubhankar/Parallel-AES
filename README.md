# Parallel-AES

Usage:

For Serial Implementation of AES: (steps)

cd SERIAL_AES

add a "plaintext.txt" file which needs to be encrypted

make

Result - encrypted.txt decrypted.txt with time

You can compare decrypted with plaintext for the accuracy

For Parallel Implementation of AES: (steps)

cd CUDA_AES

add a "plaintext.txt" file which needs to be encrypted

make

Result - encrypted.txt decrypted.txt with time

You can compare decrypted with plaintext for the accuracy

Data we used to test our implementation was tweets1m.txt which was used during Mini-Project-2
