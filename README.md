# Parallel-AES

Usage:

For Serial Implementation of AES:
cd SERIAL_AES
add a "plaintext.txt" file which needs to be encrypted
make
Result - encrypted.txt decrypted.txt with time
You can compare decrypted with plaintext for the accuracy

For Parallel Implementation of AES:
cd CUDA_AES
add a "plaintext.txt" file which needs to be encrypted
make
Result - encrypted.txt decrypted.txt with time
You can compare decrypted with plaintext for the accuracy
