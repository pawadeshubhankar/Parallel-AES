@IPIQS They actually had gone through to the masters, but they weren't being synced to the slave servers.  They should be showing up now.
Things seem to be working without having to go to Curveball.  Fingers crossed
We may have to have some Curveball time to resolve this issue.  Any downtime will be as short as possible.
We're having a problem with the forums. If you go to the MM forums, you'll get logged out.  You can use other parts of the site normally.
